Brooklynn McNeil’s homwork assignment 4 for p8130 Biostatistical Methods
1.

## Problem 1

A new device for evaluating blood sugar levels is being tested.

1.  Below is the sign test for the blood sugar readings. The null
    hypothesis is that the median is equal to 120. The alternative
    hypothesis is one-sided that the blood sugar median is less
    than 120. Since the p-value is greater than 0.05 we fail to reject
    the null and conclude that the median is less than 120.

``` r
sugar_test = c(125,123,117,123,115,112,128,118,124,111,116,109,125,120,113,123,112,118,121,118,122,115,105,118,131)

SIGN.test(sugar_test, md = 120, alternative = "less", conf.level = 0.95) 
```


        One-sample Sign-Test

    data:  sugar_test
    s = 10, p-value = 0.2706
    alternative hypothesis: true median is less than 120
    95 percent confidence interval:
         -Inf 122.1203
    sample estimates:
    median of x 
            118 

    Achieved and Interpolated Confidence Intervals: 

                      Conf.Level L.E.pt   U.E.pt
    Lower Achieved CI     0.9461   -Inf 122.0000
    Interpolated CI       0.9500   -Inf 122.1203
    Upper Achieved CI     0.9784   -Inf 123.0000

2.  Let’s do the wilcoxon sign test with the same dataset.The p value
    from this test is also greater than 0.05, so we fail to reject the
    null again.

``` r
wilcox.test(sugar_test, alternative = "less", mu = 120, conf.int = 0.95)
```

    Warning in wilcox.test.default(sugar_test, alternative = "less", mu = 120, :
    cannot compute exact p-value with ties

    Warning in wilcox.test.default(sugar_test, alternative = "less", mu = 120, :
    cannot compute exact confidence interval with ties

    Warning in wilcox.test.default(sugar_test, alternative = "less", mu = 120, :
    cannot compute exact p-value with zeroes

    Warning in wilcox.test.default(sugar_test, alternative = "less", mu = 120, :
    cannot compute exact confidence interval with zeroes


        Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

    data:  sugar_test
    V = 112.5, p-value = 0.1447
    alternative hypothesis: true location is less than 120
    95 percent confidence interval:
      -Inf 120.5
    sample estimates:
    (pseudo)median 
          118.4334
